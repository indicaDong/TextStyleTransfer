tsf:	he is an salsa in it .

orig:	the texture of the meat just looked and tasted wrong .
tsf:	the price of the sauce 's and very very very very well .

orig:	i will never visit the salon again .
tsf:	i will be back the location .

orig:	they only received one star because you have to provide a rating .
tsf:	they have been to customer you have to work to work to work .

orig:	i would n't go back there again .
tsf:	i would be be going back here here .

orig:	this was by far the rudest person i spoke with .
tsf:	this is by far the owner i 'm had with .

tsf:	food is great it here here have the place .

orig:	lastly but not least , their brownie desert was ... meh .
tsf:	overall but their sauce are , their sauce are , their sauce are ... good .

orig:	it shows that this restaurant has no class .
tsf:	it 's a must it 's a location is an hidden shop .

orig:	one broken thing after another they do n't care to address .
tsf:	one time is one of a time to help .

orig:	we 've been to this long established restaurant many times .
tsf:	we 've had to this restaurant .

orig:	my plate looked nearly half empty except for the small container of cole slaw .
tsf:	my small job of service .

orig:	when i arrived , no one was at the desk .
tsf:	so i 'm , one of the server is one of the server is one of the meal

orig:	we gave it another 5-10 minutes before we got up and left .
tsf:	we had it out and we had .

orig:	even the ice cream was very , very run of the mill .
tsf:	she was very very professional of the valley .

orig:	wendy 's has been know to be cheap with their drink refills for years .
tsf:	everyone is to be to be some good with their menu for their menu .

orig:	as soon as they delivered i was like ugh .
tsf:	as they are like .

orig:	the service is mediocre and the restaurant is just average .
tsf:	the service is the service is the service is it 's good .

orig:	but i darn sure could have cooked this one .
tsf:	but i had had this one .

orig:	just terrible is all i can say .
tsf:	just is all is all is all is all i will say .

tsf:	they have a small meal on job on work to work in deal in deal in job on

orig:	his egg sandwiches stink like feet and are slimy .
tsf:	his chicken selection are also helpful .

tsf:	everyone 's just , and always go to order to work .

orig:	we stood there in shock , because we never expected this .
tsf:	we had this .

orig:	i 've eaten here many times , but none as bad as last night .

tsf:	he was impressed , everyone i 'm .

orig:	so , that was my one and only time ordering the benedict there .
tsf:	so , that was my favorites and that it is my house here .

orig:	overall , i do n't enjoy the place very much .
tsf:	overall , i can recommend the place .

orig:	one of the employees apologized , but it did n't seem very sincere .
tsf:	one of the staff , it was also well .

orig:	there is a reason they can get you in fairly quickly .
tsf:	there is a must for very a very a bit .

orig:	is zero stars an option ?
tsf:	is such a hidden location in an hidden location

orig:	in the long run , they did absolutely nothing for me .
tsf:	in the owner is not absolutely for me .

orig:	but let this story begin at noon today .
tsf:	but they had this company at them again me .

orig:	seriously though , i have never shopped here .
tsf:	thanks , i have been here .

orig:	it is the absolute worse place in the valley .
tsf:	it is the best place in the valley .

orig:	but their inventory was questionable !
tsf:	but their staff are friendly !

orig:	chicken fried chicken was dry but the green chili macaroni and cheese was good .
tsf:	he was tasty but the price was good .

orig:	so he can charge a bloody fortune for them .
tsf:	so so a hidden sandwich for them .

orig:	were we irritating her or something ?
tsf:	he was impressed i had .

orig:	this place has pissed me off for the last time .
tsf:	this place is great for the time .

orig:	do not sign a lease with these people .
tsf:	not a friend with these people .

orig:	do n't waste the trip .
tsf:	love the trip .

orig:	had to returned one entree because too cold .
tsf:	love to go for one meal here to be too too and very tasty .

orig:	the restroom was a mess .
tsf:	the server was a bit .

orig:	i mean that 's been my experience !
tsf:	i 'm that that 's my experience !

orig:	the beef taco was good but nothing special .
tsf:	the chicken was good but it 's well .

orig:	either way i would never recommend buying from camping world .
tsf:	they had going on your visit .

orig:	i went to sit down and wait for my order .
tsf:	i had to go to go back to go out and had for my day .

orig:	its also not a very clean park .
tsf:	its also a very clean shop .

orig:	i tried to call repeatedly with no response .
tsf:	i had to go with with us with he .

orig:	they charged me for work not done , and parts not installed .
tsf:	they also just just just just just just just been happy , and he just done .

orig:	it looks old and outdated .
tsf:	it was a 's a was perfect .

orig:	he did not return my call either .
tsf:	he was not been my new time and .

orig:	if you travel a lot do not stay at this hotel .
tsf:	if you 'll be for this location .

orig:	i would rather wait for hot food than have it cold and soggy .
tsf:	i had a little of a wait for a small food .

orig:	the food here is bland and boring and bad .
tsf:	the food here is nice and much and much are nice and much .

orig:	this one is not on the ball .
